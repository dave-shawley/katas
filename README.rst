Training Katas
==============

This repo contains a number of coding katas written in *TDD fashion*.  For
more information about the practice of "Code Kata", `Pragmatic Dave has written
a bunch of blog entries`__ and the like on it.  Here's a quote from the
CodeKata_ page that pretty much sums it up:

  How do you get to be a great musician? It helps to know the theory, and to
  understand the mechanics of your instrument. It helps to have talent. But
  ultimately, greatness comes from practicing; applying the theory over and
  over again, using feedback to get better every time.

  How do you get to be an All-Star sports person? Obviously fitness and talent
  help. But the great athletes spend hours and hours every day, practicing.

  But in the software industry we take developers trained in the theory and
  throw them straight in to the deep-end, working on a project. It’s like
  taking a group of fit kids and telling them that they have four quarters to
  beat the Redskins (hey, we manage by objectives, right?). In software we do
  our practicing on the job, and that’s why we make mistakes on the job. We
  need to find ways of splitting the practice from the profession. We need
  practice sessions.

So that is what this repo is all about.  It contains a bunch of katas that I
find useful in various programming languages.
